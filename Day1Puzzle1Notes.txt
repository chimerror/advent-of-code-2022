Ideas:
How to notice when numbers for an elf stop coming in to sum up? 
    Push a sentinel (-1?) onto the stack before reading a number, if that sentinel never gets replaced, then we failed
    to read in a new number, thus, we are done with the numbers for that elf. We can then sum them all up.
How do we keep track of the max?
    It might be easiest to use the stack of stacks. I was trying to limit myself to Befunge-93 compliant things but...
    Why? The top level of SOS is going to keep track of the current max. Each new elf pushes on a new stack that
    calculates their value. Once that is calculated, compare it to the old max and pick the higher. When ending your
    elf value block, push 1 on the stack so the top value of that stack will get pushed onto the SOSS holding the max
    value.

    If the stack is Y, X, how dow we make it so only the higher of the two values end up on the stack?

    Y, X

    X , X -> Y -> Y, X, X -> / -> X, Y, X -> - ->
    if (Y-X > 0) -> + -> Y
    else -> $ -> X

    I think this is going to have to use `g` and `p` to store and retrieve values! I don't see a way to do this all on
    the stack!
